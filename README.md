## Introduction
<p align=justify>
Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery for unveiling the mechanism of ligand-receptor interactions. With the recent advances of deep learning (DL), AI-powered molecular docking methods have achieved higher accuracy for binding pose prediction and virtual screening compared with classical physics-based methods. However, there is still a scarcity of approaches to strike a balance among accuracy, computational efficiency, and rigorous physical validity of the output conformations. In the previous two versions of DSDP, we demonstrated the effectiveness of guiding conformation sampling with the gradient of an analytic scoring function. As the third version, TRIDS is devised as an AI-native docking framework that expand the similar strategy to unify conformation sampling and docking processes with DL-based model for improving accuracy of docking and screening. Furthermore, it is tailored for seamless cooperation of AI and physics to guarantee the physical validity of predicted binding poses. Being user-friendly, TRIDS predicts the binding site, parses multiple file formats, and supports Python programming and PyMOL graphical interaction. It improves docking accuracy and passes physical validation with high computational efficiency, i.e. a single docking task is done in a fraction of second while maintaining a highly lightweight GPU memory footprint of merely hundreds of megabytes, facilitating high-throughput virtual screening in reality. As a proof of concept, TRIDS allowed us to obtain hit compounds with novel scaffolds for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) inhibitor through a large-scale virtual screening.

## Architectures
<p align=justify>
TRIDS is implemented with PyTorch C++ (LibTorch). It combined multiple optimization of streams parallel computing，CUDA graph-operator merge, automatic differentiation, CUDA kernel function to accelerate the program dramatically. General speaking, any differentiable ML-based scoring function could be compatible with this framework for conformation sampling.
</p>

### 1. Scoring Function 
<p align=justify>
The main SF in the present work is the mixture density network (MDN), which consists of three key components: a feature extraction module, a feature concatenation module, and a feed-forward output layer. The graphs obtained from the previous step are processed by multiple Graph Transformer blocks to ensure that the processed node features contain not only information about an individual atom or residue in the molecule, but also information about the surrounding nodes. The resulting graphs are then pairwise-concatenated to model the interaction and fed into a feed-forward layer to parameterize a Gaussian mixed model.
</p>

### 2. Conformation Sampling
<p align=justify>
The sampling space is defined on the degrees of freedom for each molecule, including translation, rotation and torsion angles of rotatable bonds, the ranges of which are [box_min, box_max], [-π, π) and [-π, π), respectively. In the beginning, each copy of conformation was initiated with randomization of the degrees of freedom involved. During the computational loop, one variable was randomly perturbed to update the conformation at first. Subsequently, the updated conformation was optimized through the gradient descent method. Adam with learning rate 0.1 was used to update the variables, in which the above-mentioned ML-based scoring model was differentiated to provide gradients. At the end of each loop, the perturbation was accepted according to Metropolis criterion.

### 2. Usage in PyMOL
Users could use eigher CLI mode or GUI mode with TRIDS plugin inside the PyMOL window. 

![Fig. 3: Usage of TRIDS plugin inside PyMOL](docs/trids_3.png)

To make sure the correct usage of PyMOL plugin, users should run this program with two steps:
1. runing "trisite" to extract the binding site from the interested protein
2. runing "triscore" or "trids" with the binding site object generated by "trisite"
